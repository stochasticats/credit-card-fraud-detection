# Predicting Credit Card Fraud with Deep Learning

This github page consists of iPython notebooks of data analysis and deep learning model development on a credit card fraud data set from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection - Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Data Analysis and Prediction of Credit Card Fraud.ipynb
This notebook contains exploratory data analysis, data preparation and a neural network classification model built in TensorFlow, with thorough documentation.

## Prediction of Credit Card Fraud in Keras.ipynb
This notebook contains a neural network classification model built in Keras, along with more in-depth testing and validation. This notebook lacks documentation, something I wish to add in the future.
